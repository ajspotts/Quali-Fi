# Quali-Fi
Quali-Fi is an application for employers to vet top applicants

## User Stories:

- As an employer, I should be able to view, create, edit, and delete my openings.

- As an employer, my available openings should display applicants in order from most to least qualifi-ed.

- As an employer, I should be able to login and view my profile to see the latest matches for my current openings.

- As an employer, I should be able to offer the ability to formally apply via resume submission.

- As an applicant, I should be able to create, edit, and delete my profile.
